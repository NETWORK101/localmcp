# Changelog

## 0.3.0 — 2026-10-01

### Renamed
- The package is now **`@network101/localmcp`** (previously `browsermcpai`, and `headlessdev` before that). Plain `localmcp` is too close to the existing `local-mcp` on npm, so it ships under the NETWORK101 scope. The command is still `localmcp`. MCP client configs: `npx -y @network101/localmcp`; Claude Code: `claude mcp add localmcp -- npx -y @network101/localmcp`.
- Everything from the old name keeps working: `.browsermcp.json` and `~/.config/browsermcp/config.json` are read when the new files don't exist, `~/.browsermcp` (saved logins, usage) is used when `~/.localmcp` doesn't exist, and `BROWSERMCP_NO_LIMIT` still overrides the circuit breaker. New names: `.localmcp.json`, `~/.config/localmcp/config.json`, `~/.localmcp`, `LOCALMCP_NO_LIMIT`.

### Added
- **CLI.** `localmcp read|extract|links <url>` run the same tools through the same policy, for agents that have a shell and want zero tool schema in context. `--json` prints `structuredContent`.
- **Signed in, but scoped.** `policy.allowInteract` accepts `"auto"` (now the default): `interact` is off whenever a saved login profile or an attached browser is in use, and on for throwaway sessions. `true` / `false` still force it.
- **Deny rules on every request.** `policy.deny` now aborts subresources, iframes and fetches to denied hosts, not just navigations, and holds in persistent-profile and CDP modes.
- **Cloaking guard.** Publisher markdown is used only if it matches the rendered page's title; otherwise the rendered page is used and the result says so.
- **Reproducible benchmark.** `npm run bench` writes `benchmarks/results.md`, comparing rendered HTML, a Playwright MCP snapshot and `browse` on named public pages.

### Changed
- Heading self-links (`## [Syntax](#syntax)`, `## Title[](#id)`) are stripped, so `focus` ranks on heading text and omitted-section lists read cleanly.
- `focus` no longer treats a page that opens straight into a `##` section as having a lead to keep.
- jsdom's CSS-parse errors no longer spam stderr.

### Breaking
- Default `policy.allowInteract` changed from `true` to `"auto"`. Set `true` explicitly to let the agent click and type with your signed-in session.

## 0.2.1 — 2026-10-01

### Added
- **More browsers.** `browser.engine` can be `"chromium"` (default), `"firefox"`, or `"webkit"` (Safari's engine). `browser.channel` runs an installed Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge (`"chrome"`, `"msedge"`, beta/dev channels). `cdpEndpoint` attaches to any Chromium-based browser you already run (Chrome, Edge, Brave, Arc, Vivaldi, Opera).
- `localmcp login [url] --browser firefox|webkit|chromium`.
- Each engine keeps its own persistent profile (`~/.localmcp/profile`, `profile-firefox`, `profile-webkit`), so switching engines never mixes session stores.

- **Metadata-first reading.** `browse`, `extract` and `focus` use the publisher's own markdown when a page offers it: a same-origin `<link rel="alternate" type="text/markdown">`, or `Accept: text/markdown` content negotiation. Otherwise the rendered DOM is distilled as before. Configure with `distill.publisherMarkdown` (default `true`).
- **Page card.** Each result starts with one line of provenance (type, site, author, published/updated, canonical, content source) built from JSON-LD (including `@graph`), OpenGraph, `<meta>`, canonical links and markdown front matter. It's also returned as `structuredContent.card`, with `structuredContent.source`.
- **`links` reports `/llms.txt`** when a site publishes one, guarding against soft-404 HTML pages.

### Fixed
- In-page scripts failed with `__name is not defined` when the server ran through `tsx` (`npm run dev`), because esbuild's keepNames wraps helper functions. Every page script now runs through a wrapper that works with any compiler.

### Roadmap
- Attach to your running Firefox (WebDriver BiDi) and Safari (`safaridriver`).
- Optional browser-extension bridge, so the agent can read tabs in your everyday browser without remote-debugging flags.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-09-30

### Added
- **Authenticated sessions that work.** `localmcp login [url]` signs in on a persistent profile (`~/.localmcp/profile`), used automatically via `browser.profile: "auto"`. `browser.cdpEndpoint` attaches to your own running Chrome. Earlier versions always used a fresh, cookie-less context, so signed-in pages showed a login screen.
- **`browse` focus and budget.** `focus` ranks sections (BM25 with heading boost). `maxTokens` enforces a budget (default `distill.maxTokens`, which was previously ignored). Truncated results list the omitted section headings.
- **`browse({ diff: true })`** replaces the `watch` tool. `watch` remains as a hidden alias.
- **`links` tool.** Returns de-duplicated absolute links with `sameOrigin` / `match` filters.
- **`extract` returns real structure.** JSON-LD, meta/OpenGraph, tables as row objects, and headings in `structuredContent`. With `schema`, it fills the schema via **MCP sampling** when the client supports it.
- **`interact` actions.** `press`, `check`, `uncheck`, `hover`, `scroll`, `wait` (in addition to `click`, `fill`, `select`). `selector` is now optional where it makes sense.
- **`screenshot`** supports `format: "jpeg"`, `quality`, and `waitFor`.
- **MCP spec features.** Tool `title` + `annotations` (read-only vs destructive), `outputSchema` + `structuredContent`, `isError` results, server `instructions`, progress notifications, and diff snapshots exposed as resources.
- **Policy.** `policy.allow` / `policy.deny` host globs, `policy.allowInteract` (read-only mode), `policy.allowFileUrls`. URLs are checked before navigation and again after cross-origin redirects or actions.
- **Prompt-injection fence.** Page content is wrapped in `<untrusted-page-content>`, and early-close attempts are neutralised.
- `init` prints ready-to-paste setup for Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, VS Code and Codex CLI, and no longer overwrites an existing `.localmcp.json`.
- `--version`, `help`, and friendlier `usage` output.

### Changed
- Navigation waits for DOMContentLoaded plus a bounded network-settle (≤2.5s), so client-rendered apps are read after they render.
- `browse` no longer appends every link and button by default. Pass `elements: true`, which also caps the list at 80 visible elements.
- Interactive-element selectors are now verified unique (id → data-testid → name → aria-label → structural path). The previous `nth-of-type` selectors were computed across the whole document and were often wrong.
- Relative links and images resolve to absolute URLs.
- Headerless tables (infoboxes, layout tables) render as rows instead of raw HTML. Pages where Readability discards section headings fall back to structure-preserving extraction.
- `includeLinks` / `includeImages` are honoured (images are dropped by default).
- Tool errors set `isError: true`.
- Server version is read from `package.json` (previously hard-coded and out of sync).
- `LOCALMCP_NO_LIMIT=1` overrides the circuit breaker (`HEADLESSDEV_NO_LIMIT` still works).

### Fixed
- Line diff falls back to a set-based diff on very large pages instead of allocating an O(n·m) table.
- Usage query no longer interpolates values into SQL.
